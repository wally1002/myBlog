### Fatigue?
Indian bowlers did seem tired. Especially Bumrah and Siraj. Shardul lost his rythm completely. You get Umesh as a package. Those absolute brute of a delivery and those half-volleys and leg side balls. Jadeja is just to tie up one end. Siraj produced an occasional beaut to get rid of bairstow. Ali throwed it away. Pope got greedy. There weren't any good deliveries troubling them. There was no strategy. Field placement was atrocious in some spells. Shami was missed sorely. But maybe this is too harsh on them. The batting became bit easy. But India gobbled up their advantage and gave away 40-50 too many runs. 

### Tricky hour? That's Ro and KL
Rohit and Rahul negotiated the hour safely. Rohit was lucky as Burns shelled his chance. KL's inside edge missed the stumps. But they were compact and scored a good clip. India should take a leaf out of Shardul and Woakes and be semi agressive. Because once the openers get out the middle order which is in ruins will not help. Rohit and KL have should take the responsibility and wipe out the lead. The first hour tomorrow will be a test. Cloudy skiels with Anderson, Robinson and Woakes steaming in. Great contest ahead. 

### Here are the Highlights
