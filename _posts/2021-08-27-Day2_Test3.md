### Bad but better

It's been a bad day but it's better compared to what happened on the 1st day. Ishant started erratically. Shami was on and off at times. Bumrah bowled tight line and lengths but couldn't get any support from the others. Siraj was flat. It took a great delivery from Shami to get rid of Burns. Jadeja produced a peach to get Hameed. Then it was Root - Malan show. You blink your eye Root scores another 10 runs. He was just racing along with the score. Malan was unlucky enough to get strangled down. Bairstow hit some but He is always vulnerable within 30's. Buttler hit it straight. Then it took a brute of in-ducker to get rid of Root by Bumrah. Ali and Curran perished trying to score more. Overton looked comfortable. India will need to wrap up within first half hour then look down on the abyss they have created themselves. It will need multiple magicians to get out of innings defeat danger.
