### Preview
Starting with India who have less of a selection headache and more of balancing. Thakur missing out will be a huge loss as he who can swing the ball and swing the bat. But fear not we have Ashwin who can turn the ball and dance with bat. That might be the only change or maybe Ishant in place of Siraj. Rohit Sharma needs a big one and India's most experienced trio need some runs under their belt. 

England have more problems than of India. Considering how fragile their batting line-up is losing both Broad and Anderson will be quite a struggle in the bowling department too. Moeen Ali's return might boost their confidence but the batting problem will still need some changes to stabilise. 

### Predicted XI's

​	**India** - Virat Kohli(C), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Pujara, Rahane, Pant(wk), Jadeja, Ashwin, Shami, Bumrah, Ishant/Siraj.

​	**England** - Root(C), Burns, Sibley, Haseed Hameed, Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Buttler(wk), Sam Curran, Wood, Robinson, Overton/Mahmood/Anderson.

Cheering India to win and continue their good run from Nottingham.
