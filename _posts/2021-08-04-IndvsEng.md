### Why am I writing this? 

I missed the last tour miserably. I was excited to be in College and forgot mostly about cricket. I missed all 3 overseas tours of 2018 and I regret it slightly. That is why I want to write as much as I can for this series.

### Series Preview and Thoughts

I don't think India will win this but they will definitely put up a fight better than last series. Both the sides are hunting for the right balance as India miss the services of an fast bowling allrounder and England missing Stokes.    

   This series is great oppurtunity for Rohit Sharma to shut the critics about his red ball record. Siraj should definitely play more than 3 matches. He will be key with many left handers in England lineup. Ashwin will also be crucial with both bat and ball.  Pujara, Rahane, Virat, Bumrah, Ishant and Shami have a point to prove. 

​	For England the key would be bowling with swing from Anderson and Broad and pace from Wood and Robinson. Mostly they would leave out Leach for extra batting option which burdens Root to bowl more. Batting maybe the weak link but return of Buttler and Bairstow may help them.

​	Final scoreline may favour 3-2 with England winning. Leading Run Scorer maybe Rohit Sharma and Leading wicket taker Wood/Shami.

### Predicted XI's

​	**India** - Virat Kohli(C), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Pujara, Rahane, Pant(wk), Jadeja, Ashwin, Shami, Bumrah, Siraj.

​	**England** - Root(C), Burns, Sibley, Crawley, Bairstow, Lawrence, Buttler(wk), Sam Curran, Wood, Broad, Anderson.

​	Hope I will continue to write and more and cherish this series as none other.
