### The Ashwin Conundrun
Virat suggested why changing an attack that works. Jadeja is not going to be replaced. He also mentioned the pitch looks dryer and with very less grass which could also bring in Ashwin. I will be surprised if they pick 4 fast bowlers from here. Ashwin could prove as lethal as the 4th pacer. He should come in for Ishant. Everything else seems fit.

### Rejig or Remove
England have Rejigged their order from 1st test to 2nd where they included Ali to get some balance. Now they will be pushing Hameed to the top, Bring Malan in at 3. Their batting seems slightly more settled now than at the first test. Bairstow, Buttler are getting starts so maybe of them can convert big. The real problem is in the bowling tho. Sam Curran is almost ineffective as 4th bowler. He isn't batting like Dream to counter it. Overton could also give you those extra 20 runs and also be a good 4th seam option and they can bring Saqib for Wood. But I don't see Englang that way. 

### Predicted XI's

​	**India** - Virat Kohli(C), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Pujara, Rahane, Pant(wk), Jadeja, Ashwin/Ishant, Shami, Bumrah, Siraj.

​	**England** - Root(C), Burns, Haseed Hameed, Malan, Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Buttler(wk), Sam Curran, Overton, Robinson, Anderson.
