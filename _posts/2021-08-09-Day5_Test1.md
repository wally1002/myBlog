### Rain, Rain never went away.
There's nothing to write. Except ofcourse Rain deserved the Player of the Match award. It's just so frustrating to see a poised match get abandoned. It's just depressing. India had the best chance to win the match and start the series in a great way, but that wasn't to be done. A win would have increased the India's chances of winning the series by a great margin. Alas that wasn't the case. Instead of crying, let's get over it and hope for a non-rain-interrupted match at the Lord's.
