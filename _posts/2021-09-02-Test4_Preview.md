### The Ashwin ~~Conundrum~~ Assurance
Last match it was a inherently a bad decision to leave out Ashwin. He will come into this match definitely. Mostly inplace of Ishant. Ashwin along with Bumrah will play a key role in arresting Joe Root and prising out his wicket. Ashwin will play a crucial role against Left handers and in 3rd/4th innings of the match(assuming India won't repeat another collapse) 

### Middle order sheninigans
Indian Middle order seems in shambles. If there is no Rohit to see of the 2nd new ball then definitely there is a collapse around the corner. It's time that middle order takes more responsibility. Push Pant to 7 and Promote Jadeja who seems to bat with some more caution. Ashwin at 8 will strengthen our batting a bit. The flatter the pitch becomes more will be the middle order's impact. Leeds was flattest of the 3 and we lost because we had least contributions from middle order. Shami and Bumrah both should play. If India wins this then they can't lose the series so they can rest them for 5th. 

### England
England seems more settled. Wood and Woakes will return and replace Overton and Curran respectively. It will strenghten the bowling and also batting equally. Pope is all set to return to number 5 and Bairtow pushed to 6 unless ofcourse England want to play Leach which seems out of the box. 

### Predicted XI's

​	**India** - Virat Kohli(C), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Pujara, Rahane, Pant(wk), Jadeja, Ashwin, Shami, Bumrah, Siraj.

​	**England** - Root(C), Burns, Haseed Hameed, Malan, Pope, Moeen Ali, Baitstow(wk), Woakes, Wood, Robinson, Anderson.
