### Again, Root, Again
Joe Root has conquered this Indian bowling. 50 to 100 to 150 he is just going on and on and on. Indian need to find a way to get him out without him scoring these many. The day and pitch were perfect for batting but Indian bowlers weren't as disciplined either. They gave away too many boundaries and the runs kept coming. Bairstow looked solid until he fell for the trap. Buttler, Moeen stood enough time to get some crucial partnerships. India did clean up the tail well. But given how root was batting they kept on scoring at more than 3 and got a slim lead which maybe crucial enough to get the victory.

### Attack and Release
All the Indian bowlers followed this. They kept attacking but bowled a release ball every over. Release ball was put to boundary by all the batters. Bumrah bowled a great spell either side of lunch but couldn't get the wicket. Siraj's well directed bouncer got rid of Bairstow. Ishant was bowling great in the last spell and got rid of England's 6, 7, 8. Jadeja and Shami did the rest. Bumrah bowled far too many no balls. He needs to find a way or there will be another day were he gets a crucial wicket of no ball.
